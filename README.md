# UART Implementation

by Viktoria Biliouri

Implementation of a serial  communication system using the UART (Universal Asynchronus Receiver Transmitter)  protocol, for FPGA SPARTAN 3 console, on ISE Design Suite (Verilog). 

The following verilog files, compose the full process for the implementation of a communication system using the UART protocol.

The uart_system.v module is the top module and the Testbench.v the tesbench file.

The full process of the project is described analytically in Report.pdf
